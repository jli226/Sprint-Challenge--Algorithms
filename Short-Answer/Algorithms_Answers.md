#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Linear time - O(n) it's reliant only on n. So as n gets bigger so too would the run time

b)
Polynomial time - O(n^2) there are two loops that are fully reliant on n, it would be O(n squared). Again, as n gets bigger, so would the run time.

c)
Linear time -O(n) the loop runs n times, which is one.

## Exercise II
